# MedFX
In response to the need for practical applications of learned programming concepts, this project aimed to create a real-world application utilizing the JavaFX framework. The task was to develop a program that integrates various data structures and a simple searching algorithm to manage a medicine ordering system and appointment scheduling. The application leverages JavaFX for its graphical user interface (GUI) and IntelliJ IDEA as the integrated development environment (IDE). By incorporating queues, linked lists, and arrays, the project addresses the functionality of managing medicine orders and setting up appointments while demonstrating the practical use of data structures and algorithms.

Objectives
-

- Apply course concepts: Implement the data structures and algorithms learned throughout the course into a real-world application.
- Utilize data structures: Incorporate queues, linked lists, and arrays in the application to manage data effectively.
- Implement a searching algorithm: Use a linear search algorithm to handle data retrieval operations.

Methodology
-
- Update Existing Project: Begin by accessing and enhancing a previous project with new features, including the implementation of queue and linked list data structures.
- Design Data Structures: Replace the array-based implementation with a queue for managing customer orders and a linked list for storing medicine and appointment data.
- Develop GUI: Use SceneBuilder to create user interfaces for ordering medicine and scheduling appointments. Develop additional windows for managing the cashier queue.
- Implement Features: Code the functionalities for browsing medicine, searching and ordering medicine, setting up and taking appointments, and processing transactions through the cashier interface.
- Integrate Data Handling: Utilize a text file (database.txt) to serve as the program's database, storing information about medicines, appointments, and customer orders.
- Implement data loading and updating mechanisms.
  
Results
-

The application successfully integrates a graphical user interface with functional data management. Upon launch, users are presented with two primary windows: one for managing medicine orders and appointments, and another for processing orders through the cashier interface. The program utilizes a linked list for storing and retrieving data about medicines and appointments, and a queue for handling customer orders. The implemented features include:

- Medicine Ordering: Users can browse, search, and order medicines, with their orders added to a queue for processing. A graphical interface allows users to view their cart and manage orders.
- Appointment Scheduling: Users can set up or take appointments, with the interface displaying available slots and allowing users to confirm their appointments.
- Cashier Interface: This window processes orders from the queue, with options to complete or skip transactions. It displays customer orders, handles payments, and updates the database accordingly.

The use of JavaFX for the GUI, alongside the application of linked lists and queues, demonstrates a practical implementation of the course concepts, enhancing the user experience by making medicine ordering and appointment scheduling more efficient and organized.
